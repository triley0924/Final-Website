	<p>PlainsFishing offers a variety of soft plastic fishing baits that can be made to any possible color. There are 4 different baits offered by PlainsFishing. They are listed with a breif description below.  </p>
		<p> Curly-Tail Worm: The Curly-Tail Worm mimics many different prey the fish feed on including leeches, worms, or other insects.</p> 

		<p>Craw: The craw is simple and compact, but really does a great job of mimicking a crawfish which is a big part of the fish's diet. </p>
		<p>4-Inch Swimbait: The 4-Inch Swimbait mimics other smaller minnows and bait fish that bigger fish tend to eat. This is a good bait for big fish!</p>
		<p>Senko: This is a fan favorite bait. Between it's simple design, and easy for beginners to use, this bait flat out catches fish. It mimics a worm struggling in the water. </p>

			<p>*Picutures of these baits can be seen in the Gallery*</p>
